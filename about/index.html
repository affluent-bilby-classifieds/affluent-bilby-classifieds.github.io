  <h2>About Affluent Bilby</h2>
  <p>The hero of our story Affluent Bilby wasn't always ballin. He was born in the bush from a large family of eight other Bilbies. His parents called him Jacob. Growing up in the bush meant there weren't many services or many jobs. Being a small marsupial he was too busy foraging for termites, worms and other inspects than to learn how to use a computer. Not only that but there was no where in the the bush to even plug one in. As he couldn't find a job so he couldn't get a place with electricity. His parents were proud of him none the less and gave him a Nokia 5110 that they had found in the bush when searching through the sand with their long snouts. It wasn't much but it was all they had and they loved him and wanted him to have a bright future.</p>
<p>One day he went into town to make his fortune and started looking for jobs. He found out that all the jobs were on posted on these things called "websites" and that they were on this giant global computer network called the internet. Jacob the Bilby could go to the library and use a computer and was lucky to get help from a friendly library staff member. She patiently helped him access some job sites and this is what he saw:</p>

<p>Jacob the Bilby had never heard of any of these things before but he was deterred. He did some research to try to find out where he could get training. He didn't come up with much. Most of the things listed didn't even have a training course available and the ones that did would have cost him several thousand dollars. Obviously Jacob needed a job he could start off with. An entry level job. He kept looking and looking. All these jobs from service station attendant to call-center operator all required experience and qualifications. He found a warehouse job that look promising and he just needed something called a "fork-lift ticket" but by then it was time for the library to close. Jacob went home down but not beaten and he pledged to keep coming back to the library each day until he found a job. It was very competitive. He applied for thousands of jobs and he got rejected each time. No one would give him a chance but he felt that he was being automatically rejected. A giant sorting algorithm was keeping him out of work. If only he could speak to someone!</p>
<p>Months went past and he still hadn't found a role. His morale was at an all time low. Jacob sat outside the library and cried. It was hopeless! 
He wanted to make his family proud and show that they can lift themselves out of poverty through hardwork and determination but there was just no opportunities for him. Tears swelled in his eyes and he rocked back and fourth. The librarian happened to be coming back from her lunch break and she consoled him and asked him what was troubling him.  After listening carefully to his story she said that a lot of people in the community were experiencing the same issue. Even people with a lot of experience and qualifications were having trouble finding jobs. The computers would only take someone that was an exact match against an impossible list of requirements. She said she asked her parents how people found jobs back in their day and they said that the jobs were listed in the newspaper. Companies would advertise when they needed a new employee. If you needed a job you would get up early and get the paper and go through the job ads and ring them up. You would speak to someone straight away and they called you in for an interview. "What a great system!" exclaimed Jacob. The librarian said "let me get something for you." She picked up Jacob and carried him back to the library where she gave him a newspaper. It was filled with classified ads. All the large media companies had stopped selling papers as the growth of online meant they couldn't make money from them anymore. This classified ad paper was different. It was owned by the local community and run by volunteers. They do have computers but they used their power to help people in the community rather than reject them and shut them out and most importantly you don't need a computer to apply for jobs in the paper.</p>
<p>Jacob was excited to see how many jobs were listed and that had a phone number and a contact name. He called up and applied for a job listed as "meat packer" at a local Butchers. He spoke to a very friendly man on the phone that invited him in for an interview!  Jacob was overjoyed.</p>
<p>He also noticed there was many other classified ads with people selling everything from cars to clothing to furniture. He could even find a room to rent that had electricity and WiFi.</p>
<p>Jacob went to his job interview and the man talked about his business for about 2 hours. Jacob listened intently. In the end he asked the man what time he should start and he said to start early at 6am. So Jacob went home and went to sleep. The next morning he got up and came to work. It was his very first job! He worked very hard and was very loyal to his boss. He knew how hard it was out there applying for jobs so he was grateful for the opportunity.</p>
<p>But still Jacob wanted more and each week he got his classified paper to look for more opportunities. He started a side business selling antiques through free ads in the paper. When he needed something he would buy it through the ads in the paper too. This empowered Jacob just as it empowered the economic resilience of his local community.  Eventually he did buy computers when he started his own business but he made sure that he put the ads in the classified paper so that people without a computer could still apply. When his computers broke down as they often did he called a computer technician from his local classifieds. It was impossible for him to look up a technician online if his computer was broken!</p>
<p>Jacob become so well known in his community  and they were so inspired by his rags to riches story that they named the classified paper after him. It became known as "Affluent Bilby Classifieds"</p>
